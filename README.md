This is a repository of cybersecurity tools and packages to turn Manjaro into a full fledged pentesting platform. This is not going to be maintained very well. This is just for me, use at your own risk. I will update this readme if I actually decide to make this into my own distro, but as of now this is just so I can make an iso file for myself.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!
